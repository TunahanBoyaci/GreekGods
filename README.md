## Overview
This Java code implements a program centered around Greek gods and goddesses. Users are welcomed to the Greek Gods and Goddesses show and prompted to input the name of a deity they wish to learn about. The program utilizes a GodFactory class to produce the corresponding deity object based on the user's input. It then provides information about the selected deity, simulates an attack, and reveals their secret power. This program offers users an interactive and educational experience exploring the fascinating world of Greek mythology.
